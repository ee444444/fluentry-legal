## Selected Approach: Modern Academic / Clean EdTech
This style best aligns with the brand identity of "Fluentry" as an educational platform. It conveys trust, professionalism, and clarity, which are essential for a learning tool and for presenting legal documents. The Neo-Brutalist style might be too aggressive for a general education audience, and Glassmorphism might feel too "tech-heavy" or distracting for reading legal text.

**Design Philosophy:**
We will build a clean, trustworthy interface that prioritizes content readability and user confidence. The design will use a calming blue palette, rounded UI elements, and clear typography to create a professional educational environment.
